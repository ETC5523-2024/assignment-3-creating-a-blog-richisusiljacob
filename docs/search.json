    "text": "Problem Description\nThe automotive industry is rapidly evolving, and a critical question for both consumers and industry professionals is whether newer vehicles are always more expensive. By analyzing a dataset of over 9,000 vehicles from 2023 to 2025, this blog investigates how vehicle prices have changed over time and examines whether newer models consistently command higher prices.\n\n\nData Description\nThe dataset used in this analysis was sourced from Kaggle and includes information on vehicle prices and specifications for cars produced between 2023 and 2025. Key variables include: -\n\nYear: The production year of the vehicle.\nPrice: The listed price of the vehicle in USD.\nMake: The manufacturer of the vehicle (e.g., Toyota, Ford).\nModel: The specific model of the vehicle.\nFuel: The type of fuel the vehicle uses.\nMileage: The mileage of the vehicle, typically in miles per gallon (for new vehicles).\nTransmission: The type of transmission (e.g., Automatic, Manual).\nBody: The type of vehicle body (e.g., SUV, Sedan, Pickup Truck).\n\nData Cleaning Steps:\nBefore performing the analysis, the dataset was cleaned to ensure accuracy and consistency. This process included:\n\nRemoving missing values: Rows with missing information in key columns such as Price, Year, and Make were removed.\nEnsuring consistency: The Year and Price columns were checked for any inconsistencies, such as outliers or unrealistic values, and were standardized to ensure only valid records were used for the analysis.\n\nThe data cleaning steps helped ensure that the dataset was reliable and free of errors, providing a solid foundation for the analysis.\n\n\nAnalysis\nTo understand the pricing trends over time, we analyzed the average vehicle prices and their distributions across the years 2023 to 2025. Below are key insights:\n1. Average Vehicle Price by Year\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: The average vehicle price from 2023 to 2025 shows an upward trend, with the highest price observed in 2025.\n\n\n\n\n\nAs shown in the Figure 1 above, vehicle prices show a steady increase from 2023 to 2025. The average price in 2023 was around $49,500, which slightly increased in 2024, before a more significant jump in 2025, where the average price exceeds $51,000. This increase may be driven by advancements in technology and global supply chain issues, such as chip shortages.\n2. Vehicle Price Distribution by Year\n\n\n\n\nTable 1: The distribution of vehicle prices across 2023, 2024, and 2025 shows an increasing variation, with distinct pricing tiers observed in 2025.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSummary of Vehicle Prices by Year\n\n\nYear\nCount\nMin Price\nMax Price\nMean Price\nMedian Price\nSD Price\n\n\n\n\n2023\n88\n25999\n110150\n49515.65\n47222.5\n12235.28\n\n\n2024\n865\n21637\n109545\n49747.28\n47142.0\n17022.59\n\n\n2025\n6\n26190\n90945\n51020.83\n48032.5\n22236.11\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Table Table 1 above summarizes the key statistics of vehicle prices across the years 2023, 2024, and 2025. This table highlights several interesting points:\n\nIn 2023, vehicle prices were relatively clustered around $50,000 to $60,000, with limited variation.\nBy 2024, the distribution widened significantly, with vehicles available at both the lower and higher ends of the price spectrum, indicating greater market segmentation.\nIn 2025, a more distinct pattern emerged, with pricing tiers forming clear categories.\n\nThis suggests a division in the market into budget, mid-range, and luxury vehicles.\n\n\nConclusion\nThis analysis set out to determine whether newer vehicles are consistently more expensive, a critical question for both consumers and industry professionals. The results confirm that vehicle prices have generally increased over time, with a notable spike in 2025. This price rise aligns with our hypothesis that newer vehicles tend to command higher prices due to advancements in technology and evolving market demands.\nThe broader range of prices observed in 2024 and 2025 suggests greater market segmentation, providing consumers with a wider array of options, from budget to luxury models. These trends likely reflect both technological advancements, such as electric and autonomous vehicles, and external factors like supply chain disruptions (e.g., chip shortages) and inflationary pressures.\nAccording to Citation, factors such as technological innovation, environmental regulations, and economic conditions play a significant role in shaping vehicle prices, which is consistent with the findings of this analysis.\nCitation:\nJones, M.
