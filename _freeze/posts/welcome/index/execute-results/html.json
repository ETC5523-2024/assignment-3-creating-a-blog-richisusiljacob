Average Vehicle Price by Year**\n\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\navg_price_year <- vehicles_clean %>%\n  group_by(year) %>%\n  summarize(avg_price = mean(price))\n```\n:::\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nggplot(avg_price_year, aes(x = year, y = avg_price)) +\n  geom_line(color = \"blue\", size = 1) +\n  geom_point(color = \"red\") +\n  labs(title = \"Average Vehicle Price by Year\",\n       x = \"Year\",\n       y = \"Average Price\") +\n  theme_minimal()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![The average vehicle price from 2023 to 2025 shows an upward trend, with the highest price observed in 2025.](index_files/figure-html/fig-avg-price-plot-1.png){#fig-avg-price-plot fig-align='center' width=100%}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nAs shown in the @fig-avg-price-plot above, vehicle prices show a steady increase from 2023 to 2025.\nThe average price in 2023 was around \\$49,500, which slightly increased in 2024, before a more significant jump in 2025, where the average price exceeds \\$51,000.\nThis increase may be driven by advancements in technology and global supply chain issues, such as chip shortages.\n\n**2. Vehicle Price Distribution by Year**\n\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nggplot(vehicles_clean, aes(x = price)) +\n  geom_histogram(binwidth = 5000, fill = \"lightblue\", color = \"black\") +\n  labs(title = \"Vehicle Price Distribution by Year\",\n       x = \"Price\",\n       y = \"Count\") +\n  facet_wrap(~ year, scales = \"free_y\") +\n  theme_minimal()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![The distribution of vehicle prices across 2023, 2024, and 2025 shows an increasing variation, with distinct pricing tiers observed in 2025.](index_files/figure-html/fig-veh-price-1.png){#fig-veh-price fig-align='center' width=100%}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThe histogram in @fig-veh-price, price distribution across the years shows different patterns.\nIn 2023, prices were clustered around the \\$50,000 to \\$60,000 range.\nHowever, by 2024, the range had widened, with more vehicles priced at both the lower and higher ends of the spectrum.\nIn 2025, distinct pricing tiers became evident, suggesting the market was divided into different segments, including budget, mid-range, and luxury vehicles.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe analysis reveals that newer vehicles tend to be more expensive, with a notable price increase in 2025.\nThe broader range of prices in 2024 and 2025 reflects greater market segmentation, offering consumers more choices in terms of budget, mid-range, and luxury models.\nThese trends are likely influenced by advancements in vehicle technology and market conditions.\n\n**Citation**:\\\nJones, M.\n(2021).\nThe evolution of car prices: How technology and market trends shape the cost of vehicles.\n*Automotive Research Journal*.\n",
