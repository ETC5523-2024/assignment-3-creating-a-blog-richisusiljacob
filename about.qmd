Hey there! I'm Richi, currently diving deep into the world of business analytics as a master's student. Before this, I graduated in computer and communication engineering and spent over two years as a technical analyst at KPMG, where I wrangled massive data sets and became a troubleshooting ninja!\
\
When I’m not swimming in data, you can find me geeking out over the latest in cars and technology (seriously, ask me anything!). Speaking of tech, I’m always up-to-date with the hottest trends and innovations.\
\
As a data enthusiast who speaks English, Hindi, and Arabic, I’m here to help you navigate the cosmos of data science and big data analytics. My fascination with data's potential is what inspired me to create \*The Big Data Bang\*—a space where we’ll explore the universe of data. Buckle up, and let's launch into the data galaxy together!
